# TicTacToe to Learn Scala

This code was strongly influenced by [http://www.nickknowlson.com/blog/2013/03/28/seven-languages-week-4-day-1/ Nick Knowlson's Blog Post].
His code was pretty cool, and I have dumbed it down a little so, for example, it only supports a 3x3 version of the game.

I don't think I am violating any copyright, but if anyone objects, please let me know and I'll nuke the repo.

## Goals
My goals here are:

1. Get some working code in a simple environment that I can learn from.
2. Make it a Maven project since we use Maven with Scala at Work
3. Get it on GitHub so I can share, but also help show my company the value of GitHub (for the pull requests, of course!)
4. Find and follow conventions for Scala coding style, format, best practices
5. Make it work properly in IntelliJ IDEA which of course it just did since IntelliJ _rocks_
6. Try out test frameworks since it seemed like a silly idea to me to recreate one.  Call me crazy.
7. Impress my kids, which is remarkably difficult but understandable (I mean, I _am_ their embarrassing father, yo)

I would greatly welcome all comments, observations, or other respectful improvements if you're feeling so inclined.
Assume my level of knowledge of Scala is "just finished the first book the second time".
